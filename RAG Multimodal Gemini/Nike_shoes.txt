## **History of Nike Shoes**

### **1. The Early Years (1964–1971): Blue Ribbon Sports**
Nike's origins date back to 1964 when **Bill Bowerman**, a track and field coach at the University of Oregon, and his former student **Phil Knight** founded *Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS)*. Initially, BRS functioned as a distributor for **Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS)**, a Japanese shoe company, selling their running shoes in the U.S.  

By 1966, BRS opened its first retail store in Santa Monica, California, and by 1971, the partnership with Onitsuka Tiger ended. This led to the creation of their own brand, named **Nike**, inspired by the Greek goddess of victory.
